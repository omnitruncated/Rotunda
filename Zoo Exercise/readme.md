Zoo Exercise

We are building a zoo inside a computer. Each animal species in our zoo has lots of different, particular, behaviors, but all animals talk to each other in a similar way. Specifically, they all implement a ​speak​ method, the output of which is the arbitrary input string interspersed with an "animal sound" that is particular to that type of animal. For example, the lion's ​speak​ function behaves like so:

>​ lion.speak( ​"I'm a lion"​ ); <​ ​"I'm roar a roar lion roar"

The tiger's speak function behaves similarly but with a different sound:

>​ tiger.speak( ​"Lions suck"​ ); <​ ​"Lions grrr suck grrr"

Please write logic and classes to support our zoo in JavaScript (using whatever class model you like) ​with attention to code structure and readability​.
